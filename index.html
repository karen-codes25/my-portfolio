  <h1>Hello, I'm Kareen Chhangani</h1>
  <p>This is my portfolio website.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>As a first-year Computer Science student, I’m not just learning to code; I’m learning to think differently, solve creatively, and adapt constantly. I’m drawn to technology because it challenges limits—and I’m here to challenge mine.
Whether I’m debugging my first real project or diving into the logic behind algorithms, I approach every step with curiosity, focus, and the mindset that effort compounds over time. Good days teach me. Tough ones shape me.
I'm not here because I know everything—I'm here because I'm ready to learn anything.</p>
